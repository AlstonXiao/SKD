## Background Story
This game takes place in the far future. At that time, humans have run out of resources and you, the main character was sent to find more energy sources. One day, you suddenly found a strong signal of energy underneath the ground. You decided to explore, but after you enter the underground, you discovered that there is a ruin of a huge world, and the signal is emitted from the deepest part of the ruin. Unfortunately, you lost all your advanced tools when you get to the underground world, and the path to the deepest part is blocked. So you have to use the power of the artifact to get to the resource that emits the signal. But, who knows what will happen when you get there.

The history of this ruin can be traced back to ancient Roma. People living at that time got an alien artifact, and it has enormous power. A few people stole this artifact and used it to build this underground utopia. However, due to some reasons, all people in this underground world has died and here became a ruin. The main character will solve the puzzles when he approaches the artifact also experience the story happened in the past.

## Game Mechanism 
This game is a combination of puzzle-solving and storytelling. The alien technology you will use is called "duplicate space." You can duplicate a part of space, and place it wherever needed, and the copied object will do the same thing as the original object. You need to use this superpower from the artifact to remove obstacles and get to the energy source. As the player solving the puzzles, The environment will tell the story in the past, and the player can experience the epic story by the details in the environment.

### Example
