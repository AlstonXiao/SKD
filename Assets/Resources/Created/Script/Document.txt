Key set up:

WASD: Movement
Q: Gem related
E: interaction
R: put in inventory
Z: scale up
X: scale down 
C: Change rotational mode
V, B: rotation
Number key: Get things from inventory

----------------------------------------
RegidedValue:

pickUpScale: default 1
pickUpDistance: default 20
minimumDistance: default 0.5
maximumDistance: default  1.5

----------------------------------------
Groups:

pickUpAble: things can be picked up
cutable: things can be cutted
cutted: things that have been cut

How our core mechanism function

1, It will cut one object group (one object tree) inside the cube
2, if there are multiple object group, it will randomly select a group to cut
3, to delete a duplicated object, just put the gem on one part of that object. the WHOLE object group will be deleted
4, if there are multiple duplicated object group in one gem, it will randomly cut one object group
5, if there are object can be cut and duplicated object in one gem, it will perfer to cut the object insteat of delete object

----------------------------------------
Pickup System:

What value it used

----------------------------------------
Cutted System:

1, Rotation System:
	Use C to change mode, V to rotate forward and B to rotate backward
	The rotation effect stays on the object and will not be cancled after putted in the inventory
	The rotation speed is determind by the "rotationSpeed", usually
